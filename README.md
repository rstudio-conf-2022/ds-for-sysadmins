## Overview

Attendees will learn about RStudio pro product architectures, how to install and manage extension packages in the local environment, as well as how to manage these packages on your network. You’ll also learn about the challenges that face developers and administrators in scaling environments and optimising R code. You’ll uncover many of the R internal systems that govern the way that it works, as well as the mechanisms employed by RStudio’s pro offerings that harness and elevate those systems in production settings.
Admins will learn to better understand and serve their data scientist customers and data scientists will learn about the complexity and constraints of running production R environments.


## Learning objectives

How to use RStudio’s Pro Products to administer data science at scale.

## Is this course for me?

System administrators seeking to better understand R and RStudio’s pro products as well as data scientists, who need to take a more active role in the administration of R-based environments.

## Prework

None required.
